## story-quest

An interactive LLM-powered text adventure game that generates dynamic stories and choices using Peerwave's network.

This app is built on a minimal React + TypeScript + Webpack setup.
The majority of the logic is in [src/components/StoryGame.tsx](src/components/StoryGame.tsx).

Note that this application is almost entirely produced via AI agents with minimal oversight.
As a result, it's possible that there are extraneous bits of code and markup.
It's also possible the logic won't be super legible.
If you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to submit pull requests and we'll list your contributions in this README.

## Deploy

You can build the app for static distribution via `npm run build`

## Test

You can test the app locally via `npm run dev`
